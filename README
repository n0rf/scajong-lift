Scajong-Lift

A simple view for the project Scajong (https://github.com/cry-inc/scajong) 
written in scala programming languate with help of lift web framework.

This view was written for a Scala course at the University of Applied
Sciences in Constance in the fall of 2012.


Dependency:

The view does only work in combination with the Scajong project. Copy the
Scajong .jar file build with sbt command 'sbt package' into the 'lib' folder.


Usage:

Make sure the sbt.bat is configured correct and run it from a command window.
The sbt (http://www.scala-sbt.org/) version 0.12 is used and the project got 
tested with it. Edit and run sbt_debug.bat to make remote debugging possible.
In sbt console run 'container:start' (sbt version 0.12) to run the webserver.
After the start of the container is done without an error, the lift view is 
available on http://localhost:8080.
